        </h3>
        <p>
            From social outings to familial commitments, owning a car has become 
            crucial. However, the majority of standalone houses in these upscale 
            regions lack designated parking, leaving tenants to contend with street

            The Street Parking Struggle
        </h3>
        <p class="pb-2">
            The absence of dedicated parking spots often forces tenants to 
            compete for limited street parking. Sadly, this restricted street space 
            fails to accommodate the growing number of vehicles, leading to inconvenience 
            and safety concerns.<strong>Street Parking Hazards: Theft, Towing, and Exposure.</strong>
            Street-parked vehicles are vulnerable to risks like theft, 
            frequent towing by authorities, and exposure to harsh weather. 
            These challenges can result in financial and emotional distress 
            for renters.
